# DREP Coordination Root

This directory is the canonical DREP coordination root for `command-engine`.

## Role mapping (canonical, non-negotiable)

| DREP name | Standard name | Human/Agent | Role |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|------|
| OWNER | OWNER | Human (Deric) | Decisions, external actions |
| rep1 | LEAD | Agent | Primary build coordination, documentation, big-picture |
| rep2 | ASSIST | Agent | Bounded support lane, one-off tasks, reports to rep1 |

## Single coordination state

The live coordination bus is `.coord/micro/SCRATCHPAD.md`.
The live session state is `.coord/micro/STATE.md`.

`system-devin/` holds per-role onboarding and handoff state.
It does NOT hold a competing scratchpad or state file.
